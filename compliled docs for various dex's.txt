For other Solana DEXs mentioned in the search results (like Drift Protocol, Lifinity, Saros Finance, Saber, Step Finance, KyberSwap, Zeta, and Solanax), I don't have direct links to their documentation based on the provided information. To find documentation for these platforms, you would typically need to visit their official websites and look for a "Docs" or "Documentation" link.
Remember that the availability and exact URLs of documentation can change over time, so it's always best to check the official websites of these DEXs for the most up-to-date documentation links.
